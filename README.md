Emotion Detection

Have you ever been in a situation where you signed up for this online course. However, after attending couple of sessions, you dropped out of the course. According to facts, more than 70 % people enrolled in online courses tend to dropout. Why is it so? Well, there could be multiple reasons to this such as the unadaptable teaching style, quality and the difficulty of the teaching content etc.
However, if feedback system based on emotions which could predict the behavior of the student as to if they were delighted, frustrated or confused was incorporated wouldn't it make learning better?
Well ofcourse it would!!! Imagine a scenario were confusion was seen as prominent emotion within the class. What it could possibly imply is either they didn't understand the content or they couldnt adhere to tutor's teaching style. This kind of feedback can be taken into account so that the upcoming sessions could be suited better to the needs of the students.
Emotion Detection also has a wide variety of applications. Smart cars with facial emotion detection technology can help understand if the driver is feeling drowsy and send driver personalized alerts to stop for coffee break or change the music etc.
Companies are also using emotion detection during the Video Game Testing phase. It helps them understand which emotions are experienced at what points in the game.Taking written feedback from the user who has experienced the game can be inefficient. This is because it can often be difficult to put an experience into words.
Facial Emotion detection is a practical means of going beyond the spoken or written feedback and appreciating what the user is experiencing. Such kind of feedback is more reliable than other forms of feedback.
